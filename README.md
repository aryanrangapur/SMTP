# Build Our Own SMTP Server

## Introduction to Mail Servers  
The concept of creating a personal mail server is introduced, focusing on setting up an SMTP server. The topics covered include how emails are sent and received, and how to create custom email addresses using a domain.  

 

## Understanding Email Functionality  
- The basic functionality of sending an email is explained using an example of sending from one address to another (e.g., gk.com).  
- When an email is sent, it automatically appears in the recipient's inbox due to underlying processes.  

 

## Steps for Sending Emails  
- The process begins with identifying where the email should be sent. For example, if sending to `support@outlook.com`, the server handling this request is clarified.  
- A series of steps are initiated once an email is sent, involving DNS records that guide where the email should go.  

 

## Role of DNS Records  
- A DNS query is made for the recipient domain (e.g., `outlook.com`) to find its MX (Mail Exchange) record.  
- The MX record indicates which server will handle incoming emails for that domain.  
- Further queries are made to find the A record (address record), which provides the IP address of the mail server.  
- This process ensures emails are resolved and delivered through their corresponding mail servers.  

 

## Handling Incoming Emails  
- Tools like `mx5` are used to check which SMTP servers handle incoming mails for specific domains.  
- Examples such as using Skiff Email as a client are discussed, showing how MX records are configured to manage incoming messages.  

 

## Challenges with Spam Emails  
### Understanding SPF Records  
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework) Records** specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of a domain.  
- The SPF record checks if the incoming email is from an authorized server.  
- Emails from unauthorized servers may be flagged as spam or unauthorized.  

### Importance of Email Signatures  
- Adding a digital signature enhances email authenticity using cryptographic keys.  
- The private key encrypts the signature, while the public key allows recipients to verify its validity.  

### Understanding DKIM Records  
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)** records verify that an email was sent by the claimed sender’s domain using a public/private key pair.  
- The recipient’s server checks the DKIM record to retrieve the public key for validation.  

### Role of DMARC Records  
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)** records provide instructions on handling emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks.  
- Actions like rejecting or quarantining unauthorized emails can be specified through DMARC policies.  

 

## Summary of Email Authentication Mechanisms  
Implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records enhances email security by ensuring that only legitimate sources can send emails on behalf of your domain.  

 

## Setting Up an Email Server  
- DNS records enable communication between services like Outlook.  
- Email servers perform DNS lookups to find mail servers and verify SPF records for secure communication.  

 

## SMTP Protocol Overview  
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is the standard protocol for sending and receiving emails.  
- Default SMTP ports include:  
  - Port 25: Standard SMTP  
  - Port 465: Secure SMTP (SMTPS)  

 

## Configuring Your Email Server  
- Ensure the server listens on both ports 25 and 465.  
- Assign a public IP address to facilitate external access.  
- Set up an A record in DNS pointing to the public IP address of the email server for domain-based email services.  

 

## Building Your Own SMTP Server  
- Configure MX records to handle all incoming emails via your designated server.  
- SMTP works over TCP and can be implemented using Node.js with packages like Express for RESTful APIs.  

### Utilizing Packages for Development  
- Using existing packages simplifies handling requests and responses compared to manually coding SMTP functionality.  
- NPM packages can be leveraged to build SMTP servers efficiently.  

 

## Understanding SMTP Commands and Communication  
### Key SMTP Commands  
- **HELO**: Initiates the connection by introducing the sender's server to the recipient's server.  
- **MAIL FROM**: Specifies the sender's address.  
- **RCPT TO**: Indicates the recipient's email address.  
- **DATA**: Transfers the email’s content (subject and body).  
- **QUIT**: Ends the session.  

### Email Validation Process  
- Upon receiving a HELO command, the receiving server checks SPF records to validate the email's legitimacy.  
- If accepted, further commands like MAIL FROM and RCPT TO are processed.  

 

## Response Codes in SMTP  
- **250**: Acceptance  
- **220**: Server ready  
- Other codes indicate various statuses, similar to HTTP status codes.  

 

## Visualization of Email Sending Process  
- The process begins with establishing a handshake and continues through SMTP commands like HELO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA until the email is successfully sent.  

 

Got it! Here's the revised section with your exact code included:  

## Setting Up the SMTP Server  
- Install necessary packages via npm.  
- Create an `index.js` file to configure the SMTP server.  
- Use callback functions to handle commands like "on connect," "on mail from," and others for managing email sending and receiving.  

 You can refer to the [index.js](https://github.com/aryanrangapur/SMTP/blob/main/index.js) file.

### Configuring DNS Records in Cloudflare  
1. **Set the A Record**:  
   - Name: `mail` (or any subdomain you want).  
   - Value: Public IP address of your server (e.g., EC2 instance).  
   - TTL: Auto.  

2. **Set the MX Record**:  
   - Name: Your domain name (e.g., `example.com`).  
   - Value: `mail.example.com` (or the subdomain set in the A record).  
   - Priority: 10 (or any value).  

3. **Ensure Port Accessibility**:  
   - Open port 25 in the firewall and your hosting provider's network configuration (AWS or Azure).  

### Setting Up a Server in AWS/Azure  
1. **Spin Up an Instance**:  
   - Use EC2 on AWS or a VM on Azure.  
   - Choose a lightweight instance like `t2.micro`.  

2. **Assign Elastic IP (AWS)**:  
   - Allocate and attach a static Elastic IP to your instance.  

3. **Open Required Ports**:  
   - Open port 25 for SMTP traffic in the instance’s security group and the hosting provider's firewall.  

Once everything is configured, your SMTP server will be live and capable of receiving email data in the form of logs, you can store it in a database. 

 

## Managing Email Sending and Receiving  
- Implement error handling to reject unauthorized connections.  
- Capture sender and recipient information through callback functions.  
- Validate email data using DMARC records before acceptance.  

 

## Conclusion  
- Follow proper documentation and use tools like VS Code to set up a simple mail server.  
- Secure communication using DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and implement a streamlined SMTP server configuration for efficient email management.
